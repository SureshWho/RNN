        "## Introduction\n",
        "Recurrent Neural Network **(RNN)**, used for processing sequence of data, unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal state (memory) to process sequences of inputs. \n",
        "\n",
        "- Input X, Output, Y, or both could be sequence, not a discrete values.\n",
        "- X and Y could have same or different in lengths.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why not standard Neural Network?\n",
        "- Sequence might have different Inputs, outputs lengths for each examples.\n",
        "- Does not share features learnt across different positions (of the text  or symbol). \n",
        "- Does not learn the relationship between different symbols (words) in the sequence.\n",
        "- Might become very huge number of input parameters (10000 (words/symbols) * sequence length)\n",
        "\n",
        "## Notations\n",
        "\n",
        "- **$x<t>$** - Discrete value from the input sequence *x* at time *t*. Eg. $x$<2> represents $2^{nd}$ value from input sequence x.\n",
        "- **$y<t>$** - $t^{th}$ sequence from output y. Eg. $y$<2> represents $2^{nd}$ value from output sequence y.\n",
        "- $T_{x}$ - Number of sequence in input $x$.\n",
        "- $T_{y}$ - Number of sequence in input $x$.\n",
        "- $X^{(i)<t>}$ - Referes to $t^{th}$ element in input sequence X for $i^{th}$ example in the training set.\n",
        "- $T^{(i)}_{x}$ - Referes to input sequence length for $i^{th}$ example.\n",
        "- $y^{(i)<t>}$ - Referes to $t^{th}$ element in output sequence y for $i^{th}$ example in the training set.\n",
        "- $T^{(i)}_{y}$ - Referes to output sequence length for $i^{th}$ example.\n",
        "- **$x<t>$** - TODO Represented as one-shot encoding from the dictionary of possible sequence element.\n",
